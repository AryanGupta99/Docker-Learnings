-> With the previous experiment,
->  we saw that each container starts from the image definition each time it starts. While containers can create, update, and delete files, those changes are lost when the container is removed and all changes are isolated to that container. With volumes, we can change all of this.

-> Volumes provide the ability to connect specific filesystem paths of the container back to the host machine.
->  If a directory in the container is mounted, changes in that directory are also seen on the host machine. If we mount that same directory across container restarts, weâ€™d see the same files.
