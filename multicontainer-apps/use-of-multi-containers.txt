we have been working with single container apps. But, we now want to add MySQL to the application stack. The following question often arises - “Where will MySQL run? Install it in the same container or run it separately?” In general, each container should do one thing and do it well. A few reasons:

    There’s a good chance you’d have to scale APIs and front-ends differently than databases
    Separate containers let you version and update versions in isolation
    While you may use a container for the database locally, you may want to use a managed service for the database in production. You don’t want to ship your database engine with your app then.
    Running multiple processes will require a process manager (the container only starts one process), which adds complexity to container startup/shutdown
